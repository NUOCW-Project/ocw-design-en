Steering Committee Chairperson, Katsuaki ONOGI.

<h3>The Purpose of This Site (Nagoya University OpenCourseWare)</h3>
<p>
Michinari HAMAGUCHI, the President of Nagoya University, launched a program to convert teaching materials
used in selected courses into digital format and make these materials available over the Internet to the public
at no charge. By thus posting course materials on the web, the University offers the public a rare 
glimpse into its classrooms. It is hoped that this site will help enrolled students engage in self-directed study, 
plus promote communication and interaction not only between instructors and students and among instructors 
themselves, but also between instructors and people outside the University community as well.
</p>
<p>This project is administered by the Nagoya University OpenCourseWare Steering Committee 
and has been prepared in partnership with the Japan OpenCourseWare Consortium (JOCW), founded in May 2005. </p>

<h3>About the Public Course Materials</h3>

<p>Every year at Nagoya University, many thousands of courses are held.
Even within individual departments there are a great many different
kinds of courses taking place. The courses introduced here are but a
part of these, and include some courses that have been discontinued and some whose instructor has changed.
The courses that are introduced here have
been recommended by heads of departments, the Nagoya University Open
CourseWare Steering Committee, or are personally recommended by individual
professors, and all courses have received approval from the Nagoya
University OpenCourseWare Steering Committee.</p>
