<h3>The purpose of this site (Nagoya University Open CourseWare)</h3>
<p>The President of Nagoya University, Michinari Hamaguchi, launched a program
 to convert teaching materials used in selected courses into digital format 
and make them available to the public at no charge over the Internet.  By thus
 posting course materials on the Web, the University offers the public a rare
 glimpse into its classrooms. The site will, it is hoped, help enrolled 
students engaged in self-directed study, plus promote communication and 
interaction not only between instructors and students and among instructors 
themselves, but between instructors and non-members of the University 
community as well.  This project is administered by the Nagoya University Open
 CourseWare Committee and has been prepared in partnership with the Japan Open
 CourseWare Consortium (JOCW), founded in May 2005. </p>
<h3>About the Public Course Materials</h3>

<p>Every year at Nagoya University, many thousands of courses are held.
Even within individual departments there are a great many different
kinds of courses taking place. The courses introduced here are but a
part of these, and include some courses that have been discontinued or
whose instructor has changed. The courses that are introduced here have
been recommended by heads of departments, the Nagoya University Open
CourseWare Committee, or are personally recommended by individual
professors, and all courses have received approval from the Nagoya
University Open CourseWare Committee.</p>
