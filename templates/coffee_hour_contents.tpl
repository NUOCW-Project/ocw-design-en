<h1>What is Coffee Hour?</h1>
<p>This small world coffee hour is organized once every month, with the intention of increasing opportunities for multi-cultural exchange within the campus. It is place for inter-cultural interaction, where international students and Japanese students with different backgrounds meet and talk about their daily life and cultural differences in a very relaxed atmosphere. You can enjoy coffee or tea and a game (networking game), which can enhance cultural exchange or friendship.</p>
