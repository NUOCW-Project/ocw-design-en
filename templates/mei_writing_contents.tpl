<p>&quot;Mei-Writing is founded on the belief that the most fundamental objective of an academic research paper is to convince its readers to accept the paperâ€™ s thesis statement by demonstrating the logical supports that lead to the thesis statement. Our education goal is to help students publish their research paper. For this purpose, we ask our
students to develop, in writing the paper, a clear research idea and a logical argument that provides a convincing
support for the idea. Our overall pedagogy focuses on teaching our students how to bridge the gap between writing
and thinking. Under this approach, students learn how to think logically so that their thoughts can be expressed
properly through words.&quot;</p>
