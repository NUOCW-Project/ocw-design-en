I would like to think about this issue, although I have not had much success in life.  The phrase "liberal arts" may be too abstract for its meaning to be understood.  However, if a university is deprived of liberal arts, the university will become merely a vocational technical school.  Let's consider why the university emphasizes liberal arts, and what this means in life.</td>

                <td>Negative and passive answers accounted for approximately 70% of the responses to a self-evaluation questionnaire about studying at the university. Opinions on this issue were largely divided into two categories: one was that courses at the university posed problems, and the other was that the student's own way of studying was problematic.<br>
                
                Thirty percent of students who gave affirmative and positive answers cited the following reasons: positive encounters with faculty members, and having specific goals for studying and clear ideas of what they wanted to study.<br>

Mr. O.'s speech showed the difficulty in increasing children's motivational levels.  The comment "If children are coddled too much, they won't study on their own." left a deep impression.  I also think that, as a father, I have to consider how to interact with my children properly (although I am rather passive).

When you are heavily loaded with daily classes, you are apt to depend on 'tactics' to get academic credit.  It is important to think not only about that but also about a strategy for acquiring learning skills from a long-term perspective.<br>
I was impressed by Mr. K.'s thought that even a course taken with preconceived ideas about how boring it might be sometimes unexpectedly interests you, and that it may be useful in an unexpected occasion in the future.

Professor K.'s speech was impressive to me, too.  Campus activism was a distant event for me, as I belong to the bubble-economy generation.  I am interested in the way baby boomers faced this experience as they became full-fledged members of society.

(1) Direct current work in the direction of your interests<br>
(2) Steadily prepare for the next step.<br>
Your own innovations and strategy are probably required to turn your interests into your work.<br>

Nagoya University students do not seem to actually be very active in studying, although they are motivated to learn.  They don't seem to read much, either.  However, their class attendance is good.  What does this mean?<br>
Dr. S.'s speech has given me a fairly good idea of the system unique to universities in China.  I see very strong political influences on Chinese universities, such as campuses where school buildings and dormitories are integrated, an ideological education system, and chaos during the Cultural Revolution.  University students are still the elite in China, but the scope of higher education is much larger there than in Japan.

This seems to have had a great impact on everyone.  As the U.S. society is based on responsibility for self, students are entitled to freedom of choice but have to take full responsibility once they make a decision.  In contrast, there may be more faculty members that take care of students at Japanese universities. <br>

It is not well known that, in fact, Nagoya Imperial University was established following a successful lobby by local people.  It can be said that both Osaka Imperial University and Nagoya Imperial University were established by local petition.  These universities aimed to train engineers who could be called on to contribute to the war.  Even as an imperial university, Nagoya Imperial University had exceptionally close ties with the local community (in terms of both university entrance and graduation) and this seems to be, for better or for worse, related to the strong industrial base in this district. <br>  
In my opinion, I feel that Nagoya University should aim to be the best local university in Japan.  A university focusing on international-level research is good, but it is impossible to be differentiated from other universities if this alone is Nagoya University's feature.  How do you feel?</td>
